# CS-230-Operating-Platforms


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client has asked for a web-based game to be developed that works on all platforms. There will be multiple teams with multiple players, so each player, game and teams will have unique identifiers so that there will be only one instance of the game at a time. The game will have the ability to call up images from a file, so memory management is very important to make the game play smooth. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?    

This document went rather well I did not have any feedback from the teacher on things I could do better, and it came together with some research.   

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document allowed me to picture what was required when developing the code. It gave me direction by understanding the system requirements and what resources will be needed to complete and maintain the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

It is very difficult to choose something to revise when I did so well on the project. If I were to pick something to revise it would be the evaluation of the different operating. I would improve on the comparison of them with lots more research and studying of each operating system. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When I interpreted the needs of the user looked at what they were asking for. An example I suggested that they use cloud technology for their storage and server need because it will keep costs down and it would be lest for the company to have to worry about when maintaining the game after development. They are many cases where software is developed and is not usable because the needs of the user was not taken account. This results in the loss of time and money. It also hurts the reputation of developer and may impacted getting future clients.  
    
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When approaching software, I tend to break thing down to small parts. There is a saying I use a lot. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. The UML diagram is a great way to break down what is required to create a project. It allows you to visualize what is needed to create the software.
